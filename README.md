# GCP-TASK
# TASK 
Follow the below steps, all infrastructure should be created by Terraform
1. Create kubernetes cluster in google cloud platform (GKE)
2. Create simple app (e.g. in python), create manifests and dockerfile
3. Deploy ArgoCD on the cluster, your app must be deployed and updated by ArgoCD
4. App should be avaible from https, so you need add certificate ssl/tls
5. Deploy Prometheus on the cluster and configure it to collect metrics
6. Deploy Grafana on the cluster and create dashboard based on these metrics
    
# Execution of the task

prerequisites: czy Docker te≈º?
at the beginning you need install on your local system Kubernetes ( https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/ ) and Terraform ( https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) next you must be logging in Google Cloud Platform and install Google Cloud SDK ( https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install )


When u do prerequisites next use in terminal this command: gcloud init and logging to GCP, if necessary u can next use this command to logging: gcloud auth login. Next create new project in GCP, command: gcloud projects create my-task-1234 --name="task" ( my-task-1234 and "task" these are my variables !!!). When u created project check if you have a billing account assigned to it, use command: gcloud beta billing projects describe my-task-1234 , if in output you dont had billing account you can add it like this command: gcloud beta billing projects link my-task-1234 --billing-account YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID  (also u can check YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID this command: gcloud beta billing accounts list)

Next create simple app and docker file in your work file (e.g. look my files in repository)

Next step is create file Terraform infrastructure called main.tf ( look files in repository )terraform.tfvars and variables.tf to corect work. Before you start Terraform initialization, open main.tf find resource "null_resource" "docker_build_and_push" and set path to your dockerfile. Change the variable in terraform.tfvars to your own project_id, after that you will need to fill the variables.tf file with your data (project_id, git repository, path git repository, domain).

Now u can use command: terraform init and terraform apply. 

Now u need create git repository with deployment and service your app ( look here https://github.com/dondanielos19/task-gcp-agroCD/tree/master/hello-world-flask/manifests ) and set in deployment your image. Use this command to find image paht: gcloud artifacts docker images list us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-task-1234/repo --project=my-task-1234 and add tag v1 (e.g. us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-task-1234/repo/hello-world-flask:v1 ). Go to variables.tf find resource and fill url git repository and path. Use terraform apply, now you shouldn't have any errors. 

Now it's time to set ur DNS in site your domain operator. Use this command: gcloud dns record-sets list --zone=sikalafa-zone --name=sikalafa.pl --type=NS  (name is your domain name), outputs are google NS records. In panel your domain operator you must change operator rekords to your google NS records. Now u can managed records from using google Cloud DNS and your ssl/tls certificates should start working but don't forget about waiting for finish propagation (use this side to check propagation status https://www.whatsmydns.net/ ). 

If you set DNS and propagation is finish, app should available from https because ingress and certificates configuration is in main.tf.

Now you can configure prometheus to collect metrics from the application service. Get your ip from hello-world-flask services using this command: kubectl get services

Add your IP in this config:
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'FlaskAPP'
static_configs:
- targets: ['YOUR-IP']

and add this config job to configmap: kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server -n monitoring
