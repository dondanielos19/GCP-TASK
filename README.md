# GCP-TASK
# TASK 
Follow the below steps, all infrastructure should be created by Terraform
1. Create kubernetes cluster in google cloud platform (GKE)
2. Create simple app (e.g. in python), create manifests and dockerfile
3. Deploy ArgoCD on the cluster, your app must be deployed and updated by ArgoCD
4. App should be avaible from https, so you need add certificate ssl/tls
5. Deploy Prometheus on the cluster and configure it to collect metrics
6. Deploy Grafana on the cluster and create dashboard based on these metrics
    
# Execution of the task

prerequisites: czy Docker te≈º?
at the beginning you need install on your local system Kubernetes ( https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/ ) and Terraform ( https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) next you must be logging in Google Cloud Platform and install Google Cloud SDK ( https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install )


When u do prerequisites next use in terminal this commend: gcloud init and logging to GCP, if necessary u can next use this commend to logging: gcloud auth login. Next create new project in GCP, commend: gcloud projects create my-task-123 --name="task" ( my-task-123 and "task" these are my variables !!!). When u created project check if you have a billing account assigned to it, use commend: gcloud beta billing projects describe my-task-123 , if in output you dont had billing account you can add it like this commend: gcloud beta billing projects link my-task-123 --billing-account YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID  (also u can check YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID this commend gcloud beta billing accounts list)

Next create simple app and docker file in your work file (e.g. look my files in repository)

Next step is create file Terraform infrastructure called main.tf ( look files in repository ) and variables.tf to corect work. Before starting Terraform initialization, you need to fill the variables.tf file with your data.
